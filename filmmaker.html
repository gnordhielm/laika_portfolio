    “Water Can Float a Boat, Water Can Sink a Boat” 2013 
    <br><br>
    I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It’s a charming college town, and it’s dangerously comfortable. I worked at a restaurant there called Cafe Zola - where I had as coworkers a number of college graduates who were very much resigned to that comfort. A few of them were perfectly affable, but the greater portion were frustrated and perpetually scowling. My takeaway was this: if ever I found myself comfortable but unhappy, I should reject the comfort before I accepted the unhappiness. Making movies, though often a source of discomfort, has always made me happy. The sense of fulfillment brought with the completion of every film project I take on feels profoundly nourishing. One of the projects I look back on with the greatest sense of relief and accomplishment is presented below.
    <br><br>
    The title of the short translates to “Water Can Float a Boat, Water Can Sink a Boat”. It’s in Chinese because I turned it in as an assignment for my senior Chinese class, two years ago. In short, I wanted to make a movie, on a scale I knew to be impossible given the demands of school, so I found a way to write it off as a part of school. Even better - I found a group project to appropriate. Five of my classmates placed a fraction of their GPAs in my hands, I very quickly wrote a script, and we translated it together. There was a bump - as there was bound to be - when I realized how resistant they were to memorize lines or set aside their lunch hour. It was my passion project, after all. I reallocated roles: I would create every frame of it on my computer, and they would subtitle it. I thereby rescued it from their dispassion. “Float a Boat” became an animated short, and I became, for the first time, an animator. I had a cartooning teacher in middle school - around the time I started at Zola, actually - and I remember him telling me about an attempt he made to write a musical, “It’s possible to <em>learn</em> anything you want, so, really, you can <em>do</em> anything you want.” That was my thinking, too. It turns out, he’s right. It took me three months and a lot of negotiating with worried classmates, but we all came out of it with good marks, and I get to watch something which used to exist only in my head.

    I learned what the demands of a short film project were by making a bunch of them. I have a library of attempts both laughable and compelling. Below are four which fall nearer the "compelling" end of the spectrum. If any titles do pique your curiousity, I would suggest that you click on them, and let them wait in their respective tabs while you review the rest of my portfolio.
