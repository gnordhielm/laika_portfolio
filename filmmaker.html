    “Water Can Float a Boat, Water Can Sink a Boat” 2013 
    <br><br>
    This short was the product of a long seated ambition I had in high school to make a substantive movie under the guise of a school project. Finally, a project came along in my Chinese class, and I talked my teacher into letting me get very ambitious. This five minute movie ended up taking three months to complete. I worked on my own to animate tens of different shots, lip-sync thousands of frames, and to write the movie. 
    <br><br>
    The project was in fact a group one, and originally I had my five groupmates cast for a live-action piece. But soon I realized how resistant they were to memorize lines or set aside their lunch hour, and decided I had to take more responsibility for my own passion project. With the help of one classmate in recording vocal performances, and the others in translating, I was able to focus all of my energy rotating through the various tasks requisite to creating the movie. What resulted is at least a charming and entertaining effort, borne of and constanty demanding an industrious attitude.

    I learned what the demands of a short film project were by making a bunch of them. I have a library of attempts both laughable and compelling. Below are four which fall nearer the "compelling" end of the spectrum. If any titles do pique your curiousity, I would suggest that you click on them, and let them wait in their respective tabs while you review the rest of my portfolio.
