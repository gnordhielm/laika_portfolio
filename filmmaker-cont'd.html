    <p id="essay">I had an industrious habit, in high school, of twisting school assignments into film projects whenever I could. In my chinese class, we had a long tradition of making music videos each year, thanks in no small part to my teacher’s awareness of my habit, and generosity of spirit. As the last year approached, I was determined to do something more elaborate, cogent, and impressive. So when the assignment was dealt out, I got together with my group, asked them if I could just write a narrative script, translate it, and get them to play the parts. I was making things more complicated than they needed to be. But they agreed. What proved impossible, especially with the limited enthusiasm of my peers and my own overzealous vision, was getting everybody together at the same time, in the same place. Much less with their lines learned. We played around with doing it in english - subtitles to be added. We tried hiding scripts everywhere - it was no fun.

    I decided to condense the performance component of it as much as possible. I could animate a whole movie on my computer in after effects, right? Turns out, with enough delerious perseverance, sure. By the time I had everything ready to go, the only member of my group left who was really enthused was Michelle. A dream. The two of us ended up recording all of the dialogue. She then very nobly hid her concern as I asked for extension after extension. But, I finished the project, and while there’s room for improvement, it does seem that will does always find a way.

    I ended up lopping off a whole chunk of reconciliatory dialogue at the end, in part because it was sappy. And in part because there’s a poignancy, however juvenile in conception, to the ending as it stands. Also, a whole month of work cut away. I recently understood that I may have been expressing my feelings about my parents’ divorce. There’s a certain satisfaction I derive from knowing, however secretly, that I’ve put part of me in a more enduring and accessible medium than the moments are as I live them and react to them.
